**Scene:**
*Meeting Room at Finclusion's Office*

**Ore:** *(Calmly)* Osho, I wanted to check in on the progress of the user authentication module. We’re scheduled to deliver it by next Friday. Are we on track?

**Osho:** *(Concerned)* Honestly, Ore, I don’t think we can make that deadline. We ran into some API integration issues, and testing is taking longer than expected.

**Ore:** I understand. Can you walk me through the challenges you’re facing?

**Osho:** Sure. The third-party verification service has been inconsistent, causing delays in our testing. If we push forward without thorough testing, we risk security vulnerabilities.

**Abiodun:** Also, from the frontend side, we’ve encountered some unexpected UI responsiveness issues that need to be addressed before launch.

**Ore:** That makes sense. Security and usability are priorities. However, we need to balance quality with delivery. Is there any way we can meet the deadline with adjustments?

**Osho:** If we focus on core functionalities and postpone non-critical features to a later update, we might be able to deliver a stable version on time.

**Abiodun:** I agree. If we optimize our workflow and perhaps get an additional resource for frontend debugging, we can stay close to the deadline.

**Ore:** That’s a good compromise. Let’s list the must-have features and push the rest to phase two. I’ll also see if we can allocate additional resources to help with testing and UI fixes.

**Osho:** That would help a lot. I’ll send an updated breakdown by the end of the day.

**Abiodun:** And I’ll coordinate with the UI team to streamline the fixes.

**Ore:** Great! Thanks for your input, Osho and Abiodun. I appreciate your commitment to quality and delivery.

**Osho:** Thanks, Ore. Let’s make this work!

**Abiodun:** Sounds like a plan!

**Resolution Outcome:**
- Ore, Osho, and Abiodun reach a compromise by prioritizing essential features.
- Additional resources are considered to speed up testing and UI fixes.
- The project stays on track without compromising security or usability.
