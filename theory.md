# Theoretical Questions 
## 1. Define the four phases of the project lifecycle.
- **Initiation:** This is the first phase, where the project goals, objectives, and feasibility are determined. Key stakeholders are identified, and a high-level plan is created.
- **Planning:** In this phase, a detailed project plan is developed, outlining the scope, timeline, resources, risk management, and communication plans.
- **Execution:** This is the implementation phase where the project team carries out the tasks, following the project plan. Regular monitoring and updates are made to ensure alignment with objectives.
- **Closure:** The final phase where the project is reviewed, deliverables are handed over, performance is evaluated, and lessons learned are documented.

## 2. Compare Agile vs. Waterfall methodologies. When should each be used?
- **Agile:** Agile is an iterative approach that allows for continuous feedback and flexibility. Work is divided into smaller increments (sprints), allowing changes as needed.
- **Waterfall:** Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It is highly structured and follows a fixed plan.
- **When to use Agile:** Agile is best for projects requiring adaptability, such as software development, where frequent changes and user feedback are expected.
- **When to use Waterfall:** Waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, such as construction or manufacturing, where changes are costly.

## 3. List three best practices for effective communication in project management.
1. **Clear and concise communication:** Use simple language and avoid jargon to ensure all team members understand the message.
2. **Regular updates and meetings:** Conduct daily stand-ups, status updates, or progress reports to keep everyone aligned.
3. **Use project management tools:** Utilize tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Trello for seamless communication and collaboration.

## 4. What are the common causes of conflict in teams, and how can they be resolved?
- **Common causes:** 
  - Poor communication
  - Misaligned goals or priorities
  - Resource constraints or workload imbalance
- **Resolution strategies:**
  - Encourage open communication and active listening.
  - Mediate discussions to align team members on goals.
  - Ensure fair distribution of workload and clarify responsibilities.

## 5. Explain the purpose of Gantt charts in project management.
Gantt charts are visual tools used to plan and track project schedules. They show tasks, their dependencies, and deadlines in a timeline format, making it easier to manage workloads and deadlines.

## 6. What is a risk register, and how is it used?
A risk register is a document used to identify, assess, and track potential risks in a project. It includes details such as risk descriptions, impact levels, likelihood, mitigation strategies, and responsible persons. It helps project managers proactively manage risks.

## 7. Define the difference between mitigating and contingency planning in risk management.
- **Mitigating planning:** Actions taken to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk occurring.
- **Contingency planning:** A backup plan or response strategy in case a risk materializes.
